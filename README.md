# Stout Case Study 1
This project was made by [Christos Aivazidis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aiva00) as part of the Stout's Case Study 1

The repo contains the webapp that runs on streamlit cloud and was made by streamlit. In the webapp you can see the full process as well as all the visualizations.  
  
You can also check the jupyter notebook for a more hands-on approach.  
  
More emphasis was given on the analysis rather than the webapp or anything else, cause it was deemed to be the most important due to the limited amount of time.  
  
If you take a look at the code, you can see that I tried to make it as Object Oriented, Scalable and Abstracted as possible but it is not a really good effort.  

More time was needed overall.
